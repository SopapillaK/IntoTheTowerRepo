New Features:

As a classic player, I want the boss to be restricted to the boss area so that it can't just chase me around the whole floor.

As a player with eyes, I want the outside of the tower to not be light blue so that I don't think I'm looking at the sky.

As a player with a bigger monitor, I want the UI to scale according to the monitor so that I can always know what my health is and I can always easily see the text for controls.

(ONLY WORKS IN UNITY) As a player who wants to play games again and again, I want to be able to restart my game manually so that I can do it again without having to die.
