# IntoTheTowerRepo
Test: https://sopapillak.github.io/IntoTheTowerRepo/
New Features:

Enemies color changed to orange.

Added more grass and plants to better fill out the space.

As an audio based player, I want to be able to hear when the doors open or closed because it adds to the atmosphere.

As an audio based player, I want to be able to hear the sword swings for the boss and enemies so that I don't have to be looking right at them to know when they swung.

As a visual player, I want the boss area to be decorated so that it is more visually interesting.

As an atmospheric player, I want to be able to hear the environment so that I feel like I'm really there.

As a new to games player, I want better direction of what I need to do so that I'm not confused on what to do next.
