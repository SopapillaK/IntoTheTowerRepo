# IntoTheTowerRepo
Test: https://sopapillak.github.io/IntoTheTowerRepo/

New Features:

As an audio based player, I want to be able to hear when the rock disappear so that I don't have to be looking at it to see if I opened it.

As a player that misses visual details, I want something to indicate that there is a boss area that is blocked so that I know it's there.

As a skilled player, I want a way to adjust the mouse sensitivity so that I can play to my fullest.
