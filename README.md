# IntoTheTowerRepo
Test: https://sopapillak.github.io/IntoTheTowerRepo/
New Features:

As a newer player, I want instruction on what I need to do to go to the next floor so that I am not confused.

As a hard core player, I want the boss to have a higher health so that there is more challenge to beat it.

As a skilled player, I want something to indicate all my controls so that I can play to my fullest.

As a classic player, I want the boss to be unlocked so that I can't fight it first.
